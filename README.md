# Mechine-Learning-course-Edge-project
🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of breast cancer (benign or malignant) using Machine Learning models.
We use datasets (such as the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset) and apply various classification algorithms to achieve high accuracy.

📂 Dataset

Source: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (UCI/Sklearn)

Features include cell nucleus measurements (radius, texture, smoothness, etc.)

Target:

0 = Benign (non-cancerous)

1 = Malignant (cancerous)
